# 1. CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE
-----**Client-Server** architecture is a **Network Model** where **client devices (like your computer or phone) request services or data from a central server.**
 

                                             Basic Concepts

Client: **A program or device that sends requests to a server.**

Server: **A program or device that listens for requests from clients and responds to them.**

                                                How It Works

-----Client initiates a **request to the server** (e.g., asking for a webpage).

-----**Server processes the request** (e.g., fetches the HTML page).

-----**Server sends a response** back to the client (e.g., the requested webpage).

-----Client **renders or uses the data as needed**.


                                       Types of Client-Server Architecture
✅ **Two-tier Architecture**

Client <---> Server

Example: Web browser directly talking to a database server (not recommended for large systems).

✅ **Three-tier Architecture**

Client <---> Application Server <---> Database Server

Most common: separates logic, presentation, and data.

✅ **N-tier Architecture**

Adds more layers like caching servers, load balancers, etc., for large-scale systems.

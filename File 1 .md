# 1. CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE
-----**Client-Server** architecture is a **Network Model** where **client devices (like your computer or phone) request services or data from a central server.**
 

                                                       Basic Concepts

Client: **A program or device that sends requests to a server.**

Server: **A program or device that listens for requests from clients and responds to them.**

                                                        How It Works

-----Client initiates a **request to the server** (e.g., asking for a webpage).

-----**Server processes the request** (e.g., fetches the HTML page).

-----**Server sends a response** back to the client (e.g., the requested webpage).

-----Client **renders or uses the data as needed**.
